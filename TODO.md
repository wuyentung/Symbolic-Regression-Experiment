# Production function properties (according to *Cobb-Douglas* production function)
### Q = A * L^α * K^β
### Give a penalty if expression doesn't follow **one** of it or **all**
- Parameters:
    1. A, α and β is positive constant
        1. ~~A > 0:~~
            - bottom up, len(["minus"]+["-" and rightsub]) //2 == 0
        1. α, β is consant:
            - bottom up, encounter "**" and leftsub
            - and which "**" rightsub is Numbers (len(get_leaves) == 0)
            1. α, β > 0: (top-down)
                - "**" rightsub > 0
            1. α, β ≤ 1:
                - sum("**" rightsub) ≤ 1
    1. we define α + β ≤ 1
- For **INPUTS**
    1. **positive effect** for each input
    1. multipling relationship for each other
    1. sum of the expoential ≤ 1 
- For **OUTPUTS**
    1. **trade-off effect** for each output
